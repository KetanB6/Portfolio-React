  { id: "TinyCut", deployed: true, title: "TinyCut: Web based URL Shortner", img: TinyCut, github: "https://github.com/KetanB6/TinyCut", link: "https://tiny-cut.vercel.app/", description: " is a simple URL shortener built with Spring Boot and React that converts long links into short, easy-to-share ones. The backend generates unique short codes and maps them to original URLs, while the frontend retrieves and redirects using those codes. It provided hands-on experience with REST APIs, API integration, and full-stack deployment." },
  { id: "OneView", deployed: true, title: "ViewOne: Share it once, then it gone", img: OneView, github: "https://github.com/KetanB6/OneView", link: "https://one-view.vercel.app/", description: " is a web app where users can save a message, get a unique code, and view it once—after that, it’s deleted from the database. I developed the backend in Spring Boot (REST + JPA) while learning the Spring Framework, and set up the frontend in React (with some help from ChatGPT).✨ This kind of “view-once” message system can be useful in the real world for securely sharing sensitive information like temporary passwords, confidential notes, or private links." },
  { id: "Padarth", deployed: false, title: "Padarth: Ingredient Info. Provider", img: Padarth, github: "https://github.com/KetanB6/Padarth", link: null, description: " is a web-based ingredient analysis tool that lets users scan, upload, or search ingredients to check their health safety. It captures or uploads images, extracts text, and processes it using Gemini AI to fetch ingredient details. The results are displayed via JSP for a smooth user experience. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Servlets, and JSP, the project strengthened skills in backend development and API integration." },
  { id: "MindCalc", deployed: true, title: "MindCalc: Mental Calculation", img: MindCalc, github: "https://github.com/KetanB6/MindCalc", link: "https://mindcalc.onrender.com", description: " is a browser-based math game that challenges users to solve problems under time pressure. It features timed addition challenges, score tracking, and a clean, responsive UI. Built with Java Servlets, HTML, and CSS, it strengthened skills in session-based logic, backend handling, and frontend design." },
  { id: "Bank Management System", deployed: false, title: "Banking Application With JDBC", img: BankingApp, github: "https://github.com/KetanB6/Hotel-Reservation-System", link: "", description: ", My first Java project – Banking Management System using JDBC and MySQL. It’s a console-based application that supports user registration/login, account creation with secure PINs, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, balance checks, and PIN updates. I implemented transaction management for data integrity and used PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection, which gave me strong hands-on experience with Java, JDBC, and database handling." },
  { id: "Hotel Resrvation System", deployed: false, title: "Hotel Management System With JDBC", img: HotelApp, github: "https://github.com/KetanB6/Bank-Management-System", link: "", description: "  in Java using JDBC and MySQL. This console-based project simulates real-world hotel operations with CRUD functionality, including room availability checks, guest reservations, booking updates, and handling departures. It was my first JDBC project, which gave me practical experience in database integration, query handling, and building interactive Java applications." }
